# iDeal Bachata School

This is a website for a fictional dance school that teaches bachata. The website is primarily meant for prospective students, providing information about the courses on offer, along with a schedule, as well as copy convincing prospective students why they should dance, and why they should choose this school over others. 

This was created as an assignment for the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer course following their modules on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and User Centric Front-End Development.

## UX

### User Stories

As a newbie dancer who is thinking about dancing bachata (or just dancing in general) for the first time I expect to get an overview of what bachata is and why I should choose this school over others, as well as the benefits of dancing. I also expect the ability to sign up for classes.

As a prospective customer who has danced bachata before I expect to get an overview of the classes on offer, a reason to choose this school over others as well as a schedule clearly showing when the classes take place. I also expect the ability to sign up for classes.

### Strategy

My goal with the design was to create a professional yet minimalistic design that was easy for users to navigate that not only includes the basic course information but also incorporates certain marketing elements that I believe (based on my experience in marketing) every business should have:
* Copy to convince prospective customers why they should learn to dance (something that is often lacking on the websites of dance schools in Stockholm)
* Copy about why they should choose this school over the competition
* An opt-in form that exchanges information the user wants in exchange for a way to follow up later (email). 


### Structure

A one-page layout was chosen so that users will not have to load or navigate around a variety of different pages to find the information they are looking for. A one-page layout also presents all the information in its optimum order.

The top navigation will be fixed and provide links that allow the user to quickly jump to the sections they are interested in.

As for the structure of the content I decided to go with was to have a large header with a hero image, incorporating an opt-in form that exchanges some form of information that is valuable to someone who dances (or is thinking about) dancing bachata in exchange for a way to stay in touch with them (in this case email).

This will be followed by copy that presents the benefits of dancing, then a brief overview of what bachata is, followed by copy telling the potential customer what makes this dance school different.

This will be followed by brief descriptions of the different classes on offer.

### Surface

The blue/white/grey color scheme that was used is the same color scheme used by the website of the dance school iDance (idance.se). I chose this color scheme because I thought it looked good. 

Using background images for every other section makes the site look better than simply having one long white page. It also provides a break for the eyes as opposed to having image after image which I find can become slightly overwhelming.

Boxes with white backgrounds were used for text in image sections because text that is overlaid directly on an image is harder to read.

The design for the weekly schedule was chosen because it provides a relatively clear overview of when the classes take place without incorporating a lot of blank space which a design that shows a full 24 hour day would have (since no classes take place during the daytime).

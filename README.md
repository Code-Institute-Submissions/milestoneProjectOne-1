# iDeal Bachata School

This is a website for a fictional dance school that teaches bachata. The website is primarily meant for prospective students, providing information about the courses on offer, along with a schedule, as well as copy convincing prospective students why they should dance, and why they should choose this school over others. 

This was created as an assignment for the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer course following their modules on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and User Centric Front-End Development.

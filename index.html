                <p>Have you been thinking about taking dance lessons? You’re not alone! More and more people are taking classes. So why are people flocking to dance? 
                I’ll tell you why. And perhaps you’ll be moved to give it a try, too.</p>
                <ul class="fa-ul">
                    <li>
                        <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check-circle homepageListIcon"></i></span>
                        It’s FUN exercise. FUN EXERCISE?! That’s the holy grail!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check-circle homepageListIcon"></i></span>
                        Being a dancer gives you an enormous boost in confidence. Most people are scared to death of dancing in public. They need alcohol or safety in numbers. As a dancer, you just need some good music.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check-circle homepageListIcon"></i></span>
                        Dancing helps you get out of your head. Thinking is awesome but instead of being constantly wrapped up your thoughts, give yourself a chance to just let go and do something fun!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check-circle homepageListIcon"></i></span>
                        Dancing makes you sexy. It’s basically the coolest hobby on the planet. Plus partner dancing feels like magic. Hard to explain, but you’ll find out when you try it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check-circle homepageListIcon"></i></span>
                        It gives you a structured social setting to meet thousands of other people. Have you ever been to a party wishing there was something to DO? Dancing is the perfect social activity because it gives you something to DO! You ask someone to dance, dance for a few minutes, say thanks, repeat with a new person. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>As you can see, there are many benefits of dance lessons. If you’ve been wanting to learn to dance, what are you waiting for? You should join us and 
                learn to dance bachata. (Why beat around the bush? You know that’s what I’m saying.)</p>

                            <p>
                                Bachata is a partner dance that originated in the Dominican Republic. It is intimately connected with bachata music, which is best described as 
                                slower and more sensual than salsa. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Over the years many different forms of bachata have appeared. At iDeal Bachata we teach a blend of the styles known as Bachata 
                                Fusion, which incorporates moves from other latin american dances like Salsa and Tango, and Bachata Sensual, a more sensual version of bachata that 
                                takes inspiration from Lamba Zouk by incorporating body waves and isolations.

                <h2 class="sectionHeading">The most structured, detailed and easy way to learn how to dance</h2>
                <p>Our mission at iDeal Bachata School is to help you to fully get the benefits of dancing bachata in your life, and I dare say we do it better than other schools. </p>
                <ul class="fa-ul">
                    <li>

                        Most other school do not have a curriculum meant to bring you from complete beginner to master of the dancefloor (or to whatever level you want to go). 
                        The teachers often make up a sequence to teach you during the class that does not build on previous levels, and each teacher will teach you different 
                        things even if they are teaching the same level, meaning that you can easily miss out on learning a lot. Unlike our competitors we have a step-by-step 
                        curriculum, built around our 6-pattern turn system, that all our teachers follow, and will teach you all the moves you will need.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check-circle homepageListIcon"></i></span>
                        We teach moves, not sequences. Whilst other schools will teach you a sequence, often comprised of many moves you already know, and then leave it up to 
                        you to break out the different moves, we at iDeal Bachata School teach you the moves themselves. We believe this makes your dance more unique since you 
                        are the one combining the moves together, as opposed to following a set script.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check-circle homepageListIcon"></i></span>
                        What most teachers neglect to tell you, because they want to sell you more classes, is that on the dance floor it is not the amount of moves you know that 
                        matters. The MOST important thing is the connection you have with your partner. If you can create a good connection then all you really need is a handful of 
                        moves. We teach you the elements of creating the right type of connection right from the start. Bad for business, good for you.
                    </li>

                        Bachata music is not all the same. With varying intro lengths, parts of songs that contain no beat, half-counts, and so on different types of music work better 
                        with certain types of moves. Not only do we teach you how to perform the moves correctly, we also give tips and inspiration on to what types of music certain 
                        moves will work best at.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>We provide you with one of the most structured, detailed and easy ways to learn how to dance bachata. Our system will turn you into a good dancer, a dancer whose 
                strengths lie in the areas most important to giving you and your partner a magical dance experience. Check out our classes below and sign up for the one(s) that are

                <p>
                    You don’t learn to dance by going to classes (as much as we’d like that to be the case). Whilst classes are an important tool to give you the proper technique, 
                    the only way to truly learn bachata is by leaving the comfort of the classroom and dancing socially. Therefore we at iDeal Bachata Schools are happy to present you 
                    the opportunity to dance socially every monday, wednesday and friday night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whilst the party starts at 20:00, the learning starts at 19:00. Our drop-in classes will teach you new and exciting moves that you can use immediately when the music 
                    starts, and give you a chance to connect with the partners you will be dancing with. We provide drop-in classes at 3 difficulty levels: beginner (no previous experience 
                    with bachata required), improver and medium/advanced.

                                Our intermediate turn pattern series of classes takes the 6-pattern turn system (which should be very familiar to you at this point) and takes it up a notch. 
                                We're talking double turns, delayed turns and stringing together moves into longer turn patterns.

                    Not all change is bad. Sometimes something different is exactly the thing you need to spice up your bachata journey. This is why we often hold workshops and bootcamps 
                    on the weekends, covering different areas of bachata that are not always the focus of our usual classes, where we invite in some of the best teachers from around the 
                    globe to bring your dance ability to the next level. In the past we have held workshops teaching Bachata Dominicana, Stage Bachata and many other exciting topics.

                <p>
                    Our workshops and bootcamps are the perfect weekend activity, and are always followed by a mini-social just for our participants, if not a full on party open to the 
                    public. Do not miss them! Follow us on one of our social media channels or subscribe to our newsletter to be the first to learn when we schedule new workshops.
